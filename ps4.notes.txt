	Macro Assembler AS
	
Used to assemble code of many processors including Motorola 68000 and Z80

Here's the home page for this assembler:

http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/

Here's the documentation for AS:

http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/as_EN.html


Some basic features you should know:

	- Nameless Temporary Symbols
	- String Constants
	- Operators
	- CHARSET instruction
	
Knowledge of common features for assemblers is recommended. 
Particularly you should be familiar with labels, macros and the ORG instruction

	build.bat
	
Just double-click on this file and a Phantasy Star IV bin file should be produced
If a bin file is not produced, then an error in the asm code most likely occurred.
If a PSIV bin file already exists, then a copy of the previous file is kept

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	chkbitperfect.bat
	
Compares the ROM produced by the disassembly with the original ROM (ps4original.bin)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	fixheader.exe
	
Automatically fixes the checksum of the produced ROM after assembling.

	Editors
	
I don't recommend you use a simple notepad or Notepad++ since the asm file
is pretty big and these editors don't have a large buffer. Personally I use
jEdit and it works smoothly; it also has a syntax highlighter for Motorola
68K. Of course there are many others available, so pick whatever you want.
